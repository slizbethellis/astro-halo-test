# Astro Halo Test

This is a migration of [test-gatsby-blog] to use [Astro](https://docs.astro.build). My goal is to refactor as many of the components to be pure Astro as possible. The styling will remain the same, and the result should look identical to the old site.

The new site will also rely on Markdown and MDX to create posts, which is similar to the old site, but without a headless CMS and its GUI. Since I am the sole author of posts, the GUI for post creation isn't necessary.
